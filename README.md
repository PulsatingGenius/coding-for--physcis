# coding-for--physics

## üìå Introduction

In todays world full of computing and technology, scientists utilise the vast power available to them to help accelerate their research.
Programming is extremely important in almost every area of physics. Not every physicist has to be an expert programmer, but many are, and virtually all physicists are at least competent programmers.
In most experiments, the process of data analysis is complex enough to require some programming. More importantly, in many situations, the best (or only) way of telling whether your results are consistent with any given model is to simulate the experiment.so its a collection of codes simulating real world phenomenons or performing computation and much more .This is a place  to find or add any new script that can make learning physics much easier and more efficient for you, as a Developer,it's our goal to make solve real world problems by coding .




## üìå Here‚Äôs Why You Should Be Coding In Your Physics Course

like data science, Physics too involves a lot of data analysis. They deal with nuclear data from detectors and astronomical data from telescopes to perform all sorts of analysis and studies needed. So they too need to upskill themselves with programming, at least with the very basic languages useful to them for analysis like Matlab and Python.
If there is someone in this background of Physics who does not know programming, he is really lagging a big time in his field. Even if they think that they know the theory and practical behind their subject of interest, programming does come in handy to for a number of reasons. In this article, we will give you five reasons to learn programming being a Physics student.
